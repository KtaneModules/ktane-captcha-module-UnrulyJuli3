  title: I'm Not a Robot
  author: TheDarkSid3r
  description: 'Prove, prove, prove.

    Prove you''re not a robot. Look at these curvy letters.

    Much curvier than most letters, wouldn''t you say? No robot could ever read these.

    You look mortal, if ye be. You look, and then you type what you think you see.

    Is it an E, or is it a 3? That''s up to ye.

    The passwords have passed, you''ve correctly guessed, but now it''s time for the
    robot test!

    I''ve devised a question no robot could ever answer.



    Which of these pictures does not have a ticking bomb in it?'
